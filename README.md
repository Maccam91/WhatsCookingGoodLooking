# WhatsCookingGoodLooking
Secondary Possible Name: Cucina Simplistica

Description:

Recipe Finding App. User inputs what they have in their kitchen/refrigerator/pantry and app will sort and find recipes that consist of those items. User will then be able to make a meal out of the food they have at hand and not have to go out and buy more food.   

User Story: 
I'm a person who just got home from a long day and don't want to be anywhere other than at home, but I need to make dinner and only have a sparse collection of food at home. I'm no chef and need recipes based off what I have on hand. Provide me with a recipe and also allow me to give feedback so the next user knows what went wrong and what went right.

MVP Goals:
Build an app that will take user's ingredient input and return a recipe from those ingredients.

Stretch Goals (Gals):
  3rd Party API integration 
  Suggestion feature based on liked recipes
  Review Feature for recipes
  Smart Device Integration
